# Real Time Object/Face Detection Using YOLO-v3 
This project implements a real time object and face detection using YOLO algorithm. You only look once, or YOLO, is one of the fastet object detection algorithm, suitable for real-time detection with less accuracy compares to other detection algorithms. This repository contains code for object and face detector based on [YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf) which originaly implemented in [YOLOv3](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)
